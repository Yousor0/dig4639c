        Once upon a time, in a lush green forest, a proud and swift hare loved
        to boast about his speed. He often teased the slow-moving tortoise,
        laughing at how sluggish he was. Tired of the hare’s constant bragging,
        the tortoise calmly challenged him to a race. Amused, the hare accepted,
        confident that he would win with ease.

        When the race began, the hare dashed ahead, quickly leaving the tortoise
        far behind. Certain of his victory, he decided to rest under a tree and
        take a nap. Meanwhile, the tortoise kept moving steadily, never stopping
        or slowing down. By the time the hare woke up, the tortoise was near the
        finish line. The hare sprinted as fast as he could, but it was too
        late—the tortoise had already won.
